To generate a new waveform with a value of the dCS coupling constant, simply run

`python3 Generate_dCS_Strain.py --ell [value of coupling constant]`

with additional arguments (including which modes to include) visible via
`python3 Generate_dCS_Strain.py -h`

The resulting waveforms can then be viewed with the notebook Plotting.ipynb
